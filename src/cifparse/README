  This is a slightly modified version of the "cifparse" library from
the Nucleic Acid Database.  It is based on cifparse-prod-v2.  The "real"
version of this, along with documentation, is available from:

    http://sw-tools.pdb.org/apps/CIFPARSE/index.html

  This library is used read and write (primitive) mmCIF-formatted files in
NAB, using the "getcif" and "putcif" modules.

  This is only a temporary expedient to "get started" with the mmCIF format.
In particular, the "getcif" function ignores much of what might be in an
mmCIF file, and the "putcif" function writes out an incomplete (but
hopefully useable) file.

  The "cif2cif.c" code gives an idea of how the library is used: it simply
reads an mmCIF file on stdin, creating an in-memory version of the data,
then writes this back out to stdout.

  Thanks to John Westbrook for valuable advice, and for permission to 
re-distribute this library.
