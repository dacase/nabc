   The "shifts" program will compute proton shifts for proteins and
nucleic acids using a structural model from an input pdb file, and
empirical formulas for structural effects on shifts.  It can also
calculate shifts for N, Calpha, Cbeta and C' in proteins, using a
quantum-mechanical database to derive structural shifts.  

   More information (including installation instructions) is in the 
Users' Manual in ./doc/shifts.pdf.  Examples of input and output files 
(for carbon and nitrogen shifts) are in the ./examples subdirectory.
The tests also provide examples of how the program works.

=============================================================================

   To install:  First, install AmberTools20, which can be obtained at
http://ambermd.org.  Be sure to set your AMBERHOME environment variable
as described in the AmberTools20 installation instructions.  Next, set
the SHIFTSHOME environment variable to this directory.  Then, in this
directory, "make install", followed by "make test" will compile 
the program and run tests.

You may wish to add $SHIFTSHOME/bin to your PATH.

Sample input and output files are in the "test" subdirectory.  More
documentation is Users' Manual, in ./doc/shifts.pdf.
