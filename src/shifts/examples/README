This directory contains sample output files for a variety of proteins,
illustrating the way heavy-atom shifts are calculated.

To test a local version of the program, do the following:

(1) copy one of the pdb files from ../lib/pdb, and the correspodning obs file 
    from ../lib/obs to a working directory.  For example,  you might
    get 1acf.pdb and 1acf.obs into a working directory.

(2) cd to that working directory

(3) run:  shifts -qdb -refine 1acf
          [this assumes "shifts" is in your path, and SHIFTSHOME is set]

(4) compare the output files in your working directory with the ones 
    that are here
