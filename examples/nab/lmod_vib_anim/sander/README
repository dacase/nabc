In this directory Run_lmod-vib can be executed to run the LMOD calculation. 
The system specific parameters can be set in the script. Make sure that 
   number_lmod_iterations = 1,
   conflib_size = N,
   total_low_modes = N,
   explored_low_modes = N,
where N is the number of required modes.

The script assumes that the Amber environment variables have been defined,
e.g., that one of the amber shell files has been sourced:
. /where/amber/is/installed/amber.sh 

The animated modes are in the output file 
lmod-vib_trajectory that can be converted to multi-PDB format if 
necessary.
$ cpptraj -p dna.prmtop -y lmod-vib_trajectory -x lmod-vib_trajectory.pdb 

lmod-vib_conflib holds the eigenvectors representing the different modes.
